## Description

The goal of this project was to take an existing application and add the service worker to it to allow for offline use and cache any changes and store them in the IndexedDB. Once the application is back online, it will update and additions or changes to the Mongodb database.

## Challenges

This concept was difficult for me to understand prior to this assignment. In addition to the service workers, the other challenge was setting up the database in Atlas and deploying it on Heroku.
